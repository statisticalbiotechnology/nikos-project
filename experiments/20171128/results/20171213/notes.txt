res20171213_1.(png|jpeg) is a heatmap of the beta values of each probe. In both cases the samples are grouped by insulin status, and in ascending numerical sample order: the break between GSM1986144 and GSM1986069 indicates the split between the groups. Values outside of the range (0,1) are indicated in black.
res20171213_2.(png|jpeg) is a heatmap of the beta values of each probe, sorted by ascending values of probe GSM1986071. In both cases the samples are grouped by insulin status, and in ascending numerical sample order: the break between GSM1986144 and GSM1986069 indicates the split between the groups. Values outside of the range (0,1) are indicated in black.
res20171213_3.txt contains the eigenprobe of gene NM_018284, with probes containing values outside of the range (0.05,0.95) dropped.
