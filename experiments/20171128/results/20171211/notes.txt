res20171211_1.txt contains p-values and q-values for each gene. Only genes with at least two probes have been included in the analysis. Probes with any values outside of the range (0.1,0.9) have been excluded from the analysis. res20171211_1.(png|jpeg) is a heatmap of the eigensamples for each gene. The genes are sorted in order of ascending p-value. In both cases the samples are grouped by insulin status, and in ascending numerical sample order: the break between GSM1986144 and GSM1986069 indicates the split between the groups.
res20171211_2.txt contains p-values and q-values for each gene. Only genes with at least two probes have been included in the analysis. Probes with any values outside of the range (0.05,0.95) have been excluded from the analysis. res20171211_2.(png|jpeg) is a heatmap of the eigensamples for each gene. The genes are sorted in order of ascending p-value. In both cases the samples are grouped by insulin status, and in ascending numerical sample order: the break between GSM1986144 and GSM1986069 indicates the split between the groups.
