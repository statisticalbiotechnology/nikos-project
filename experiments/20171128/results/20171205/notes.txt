res20171205_1.txt contains the sum of the eigensamples of a run based on M-values. res20171205_1.(png|jpg|eps) is a heatmap of the eigensamples for each gene. The genes are sorted in order of ascending p-value. In both cases the samples are grouped by insulin status, and in ascending numerical sample order: the break between GSM1986144 and GSM1986069 indicates the split between the groups.
res20171205_2.txt contains the sum of the eigensamples of a run based on normalized M-values. res20171205_2.(png|jpg) is a heatmap of the eigensamples for each gene. The genes are sorted in order of ascending p-value. In both cases the samples are grouped by insulin status, and in ascending numerical sample order: the break between GSM1986144 and GSM1986069 indicates the split between the groups.
res20171205_3.txt contians p-values and q-values for each gene. Calculations are based on sample-normalized M-values.
res20171205_4.txt contians p-values and q-values for each gene. Calculations are based on sample-normalized M-values, with q-values calculated based on pi0=1 in column 'q_valuepi0=1'.
