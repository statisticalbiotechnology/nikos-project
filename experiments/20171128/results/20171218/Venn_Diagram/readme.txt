Creating Venn Diagram

1.	I downloaded supplementary table 4 and extracted all genes.
    Total start genes: 10750
    17 “genes” were read as numbers, not with letters in the .xlsx document. Many doublettes.
    There were 6620 unique genes left.
2.	I took our result from 13/12. Spliced at “(“. Took all genes: 1568 genes. 1066 unique genes.
3.	Code counting unique genes for each set, and in common genes.
